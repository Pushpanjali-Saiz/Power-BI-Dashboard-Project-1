:Developed an interactive dashboard to meticulously monitor and dissect online sales data. Implemented diverse customized visualizations including bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, and slicers. Leveraged these tools to extract actionable insights, empowering informed decision-making and driving strategic initiatives for optimized online sales performance.

● Firstly use the filters to divide the months in quarters and the other filter use on every state to see each state's
information. And use card visuals to represent the sum of amount , profit, quantity and average.

● Using visualizations like Stacked bar chart ( Sum of Amount by state, top 5 states who spend more amount )
( sum of profit by sub-category, which sub-category in demand ).Pie charts ( sum of quantity by category,
which category sells the most ).Stacked Column Chart ( Profit by month, In which month the max profit ).( Top
5 customers who are most active users ). Donut Chart ( Sum of quantity by payment mode, which payment
mode most used ).

● We can easily understand and analyze the conditions of online sales data with the help of a dashboard.
